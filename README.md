# skyprint
Printify/Shopify automation that dynamically designs t shirts and posts them on a Shopify store for purchase.

Quickstart
1. Set up all API keys in credentials.py
2. `python3 skyprint_hashtags.py` for creating shirts off of trending stuff on twitter
3. `python3 skyprint_search.py` for creating shirts off of trending google searches

Both will run on loop until cancelled.
